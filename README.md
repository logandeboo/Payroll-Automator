#Payroll Automator

Payroll Automator is a project which automated a payroll report for a medium sized company. Working backwards from an excel sheet that was previously made by hand, this program reduced production time from a few hours to a couple minutes. 

### Tech Specs
###### Back End
- Java 
- SQL
- Microsoft SQL Server 

###### Front End 
- JavaFX
- XML

### Limitations
- In its current form it can only produce a single type of report
- Execution takes ~3-4 minutes due to inefficient underlying SQL query

### Additions
- Intentionally designed the project to be easily built upon. Specifically the UI, database, and export classes are written in a way to be useful in producing any desired report.
